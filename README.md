# bostonHacks
This is the BostonHacks project that the team behind Linguis created, which contains the program for the demo augmented
reality application using Apple ARKit and MLKit. The user experience prototype can be found here: https://invis.io/BVE6UCC5D

This project got first place at BostonHacks 2017 see:

From Oct 28th-29th, I participated in BostonHacks, a hackathon hosted by Boston University. There I created the company Linguis, with the help of team members Yunyu Zhang, Jonathan Kong, Mingyang Yan, and Yang Liu, from Boston U, WPI, and MIT. Together we created Linguis, an Augmented-Reality educational application that combines AR with machine learning and an intuitive user interface to reimagine the possibilities of education. With an initial use-case of foreign-language learning, the framework we created can be extended to learning in any subject, improving both recognition and memorization of important subjects. With AR technology in its infancy, I believe that the future of education will be in this blend of reality and the digital landscape, using overlays of 3D objects and tools to create a better learning experience. We focused on modules that would overlay learning tools such as real-time image recognition for translation and recording notes in real-time to create a framework that will in the future work with AR headsets, but today works well with your phone. Other modules in our demo include character writing and feedback as well as finger and gesture tracking. With Linguis, we imagined what the future of education would be utilizing AR, and brought this closer to reality.
